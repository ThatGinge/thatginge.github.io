<h2> About the Pro </h2>
<p>
Halldor Helgason is a professional snowboarder from Iceland. Along with his older brother, "Eiki",
Halldor owns several businesses, including Lobster Snowboards and Switchback Bindings. His style is very different than
many snowboarders, instead of working on technical tricks and competitions, he has become a master of
street snowboarding. He stars in many snowboarding films, such as Never Not and NOTOBO. In these films, Halldor performs tricks
off of anything he can find: rooftops, park staircases, statues, even an abandoned boat, as shown in NOTOBO.
